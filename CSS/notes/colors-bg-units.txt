CSS can give wide range of colors, you can represent colors through
name,
hexcode(like #c56b05)
rgb(152,85,220)-- minimum 0 , maximum 255
rgba() -- a is alpha from 0.0 to 1.0

background: we can provides backgrounds in CSS through different ways like 
background-color:red;
background-image:url('path')
but if the image size is not fit to the screen size, image may repeat, to control, we can use
background-repeat: repeat/repeat-x/repeat-y/no-repeat
background-size: auto/contain/cover
background-position: we can keep position of background in different places such as left,right,top,bottom,center
backgrounds can also be multi colors such as linear gradient or radial gradient
background:linear-gradient(to right,red,blue);
background:radial-gradient(red,blue) -- comes in circle


there are different types of fonts available
----> serif -- they are having a stroke at each end
----> sans-serif -- they are not having any stroke
----> monospace -- all letter same height
----> cursive --- letter combined with some style
----> fanatsy -- new letters which cannot be classified

we get fonts from google fonts, dafonts, 1000fonts

units: we can define our website to have multiple units 
like
px-- pixel
vh/vw -- visible width/visible height
em -- enumerated value- it always takes x times of parents font size
rem -- root enumerated value -- it always x time of roots font size(16px)
