Cascading style sheets are introduced in 1994 . they are used for styling/designing of the web page

TO understand , we need to understand 3 basic things
1. different type of CSS
2. different selectors
3. designs

To achieve this CSS follows 3 ways. they are
1. inline CSS : we can write CSS of any element in the same line using style as a attribute
<h1 style="color:"red"">fghjdf</h1>
2. internal CSS: In the head , we can write style as a element and present style inside it
3. external CSS: external css is some css file and linked to html through link tag
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path" />

There are three ways you can select an element
by tag
by class   --->  dot
by id      --->  #
