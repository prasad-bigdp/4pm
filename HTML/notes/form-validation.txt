Can you do validation in HTML?
yes, we can do validation using min,max,size,minlength,maxlength,required,disabled,checked,pattern
min: minimum size
max: maximum size
minlength: minimum number of characters
maxlength:maximum number of characters
required: make that field as required/mandatory
disabled: you can make the input disabled
readonly: user cannot edit this data
  -- difference between readonly and disabled is disabled data will not be sent to action and readonly data can be sent
size: we can restrict the size of select with multiple option
pattern:
pattern uses regular expression and to create regular it uses symbols like asterik,\,[],{} etc..,
