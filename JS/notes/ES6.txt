 Ecmascript is an organization which brings updates to different scripting languages in versions
ES14 is the latest version of JS in june,2023
There is a revolutionary version (ES6) released in 2015. it brings OOP concepts to JS and it make modular programming more flexible

Features available from ES6 are:
1. let and const
   var is used because we can redeclare,reassign,hoisting.var is function scoped
   let and const cannot redeclare, let can reassign, but const cannot. hoisting is not possible because let and const are store in temporal dead zone. let and const are block scoped variable
   function dispaly(){
    if(true){
        let y=2;
    }
    console.log(y)
   }

2. Template Literals:
  Instead of using strings with concat , we can use
  template Literals
  let a=5;
  console.log("The cost is ₹a")
  console.log(`The cost is ₹${a}`)

3. Arrow Functions:
//normal function
function display(a,b)
{
    console.log("hi)
}
dispaly(5,3)
//function expression
let display = function (){
    console.log("hi)
}

//arrow function
let display = ()=>{
        console.log("hi)
}

4. Rest and Spread Parameters:
   Rest operator is used to accept more values in an array in function prototype
   we represent rest operator with three dots. rest operator always will in parameters and always will be last
   function display2 (...b)
{

    let arr=[b]
    console.log(arr)//[1,2,3,4]  [1,[2,3,4]] [[1,2,3,4]]
}
display2(1,2,3,4)
Spread : Spread operator is used to remove the array/ Spread the elements. it is also represeted by three dots
function display3 (a,b,...c)
{
    console.log(c) 
    let arr = [1, 2, c];
    console.log(arr) //[1,2,[7,8]];
    let arr2 = [1, 2, ...c];
    console.log(arr2) //[1,2,7,8]
}
display3(5,6,7,8)
5. destructuring(object and array):
We can destructure any array or object such that we can use
thrie values or properties individually

6. classes and Objects(OOP):
Object oriented programming: 
  --object: object represents a real world entity with 
  its own properties and method
  Eg: fan -- color, no-of-wings, run()
  let fan={
    color:"red",
    no-of-wings:3,
    run:function(){
        console.log("I'm running)
    }
  }
  let fan2={
    no-of-wings:3,
    run:function(){
        console.log("I'm running)
    }
  }
  To maintain standard format, we can use classes
  Class: class is the blueprint of object
  class A{
    color,no-of-wings
    run(){
        
    }
  }





7. modules
To connect multiple JS/TS files,  we need a module system. The system which arranges/combines multiple files is known as module system
  -- we will discuss module system ES6/ES2015
  -- using ES6, we can import/export data/methods from difile easily 
  -- Before Es6, we have several systems like CommonJS,requireJS
We can import using 'import' keyword and 'export' using export keyword

export can be done in two ways
export {val1,val2.....} -- we can export multiple values by constructing them as a object
export default val; -- we can export a value using default keyword such that it can be accepted uniquely to imports. It is allowed to export default one per page

import can be done in three ways
import {val,val2....} from 'path' -- we can import multiple values by destructuring them as a object
import * as obj from 'path' -- we can import everything except default in the name obj(import alias)
import anyname from 'path' -- we can import default exports directly using these
