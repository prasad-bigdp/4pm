Javascript is synchronous(line by line) , single threaded(one task at a time) programming language
But in Js, async is also possible
 --Timers:
 Timers are web API provided by browser
  setTimeout(fn,time in ms) --- fn will executed after given time
  setInterval(fn,time in ms) -- fn will get executed every time after specific is over
  we can cancel timeOut and interval by clearTimeout and clearInterval functions
  All async functions will be pushed to task Queue and will be pushed to callstack one by one after callstack is empty
  Event loop informs task queue that whether callstack is empty or not
 --fetch
 API(Application programming Interface):
  Through URL , we can send json data -- REST API
  we can access the data by using
  i. xhr(xmlHttpRequest)
  ii. fetch:
  fetch is a webAPI provided by browser, used to perform API reuests such as 
  GET,POST,PUT,DELETE,PATCH
  GET: fetch('url')
  iii.axios
