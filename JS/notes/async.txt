Asynchronous Javascript(AJAX):
   using AJAX, we can load specific parts of website
   using AJAX, we can hold certain tasks to run later

Javascript is synchronous(line by line) , single threaded(one task at a time) programming language
But in Js, async is also possible
 --Timers:
 Timers are web API provided by browser
  setTimeout(fn,time in ms) --- fn will executed after given time
  setInterval(fn,time in ms) -- fn will get executed every time after specific is over
  we can cancel timeOut and interval by clearTimeout and clearInterval functions
  All async functions will be pushed to task Queue and will be pushed to callstack one by one after callstack is empty
  Event loop informs task queue that whether callstack is empty or not
 --fetch
 API(Application programming Interface):
  -- callback hell:
  function passed as a parameter to another function is callback function
  function A(function B(function C(){
    
  }){

  }){

  }
