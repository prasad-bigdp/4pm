Arrays are used to store different items.Arrays stores the data using indexes starting from zero indexes.
eg: var arr= [2,3,5,8,9]
arr[0]=2,
arr[1]=3
and so on...

Arrays by default have some functions like
length: used to give the length of array(no.of items in the array)
eg:arr.length //5
indexOf: returns the first occurance of given element's indexes
eg:arr.indexOf(2) //0
to get the last occurance, you can use lastIndexOf
reverse: used to verse an array
push: used to push an element/elements into the array at the end of array
pop: used to remove the element at the end of the array
shift: used to remove an element at the beginning of the array
unshift: used to add elements at the begi' of the array
splice(starting-index-number,deleteCount,elements to add):
splice can be used to delete/ add any element at any place of the array
forEach: it takes a callback function  which receives array elements one at a time and perform the takes
forEach cannot return the value
eg:var x= [5,6,7,8]
x.forEach(function(val){
    console.log(val)
})
map: map is exactly same as forEach but map can also return the values
eg:var x= [5,6,7,8]
var y= x.map(function(val){
return val*2;
})
console.log(y) // [10,12,14,16]
filter: filter is exactly same as map but filter can sort/return only the items whose condition is true
var y= x.filter(function(val){
return val>6;
})
reduce: we can also use method like reduce to get accumulated logic
var y= x.reduce(function(prev,curr){
return prev+curr;
},0)

we also have other functions such as some,every etc..,
