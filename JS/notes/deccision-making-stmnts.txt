we can use decision maing statements like if and switch to make control goes based on condition's result
 i. if: it is used to check the condition , if the condition is true it goes with if and it the condition is false, it goes with else

 simple-if: only single if statement
 if-else : it contains both if and else statements
 if-else if : it contains if-else ladder
 nested if: if inside another if

 ii. switch: switch is used when we have multiple options to choose
 in switch we have cases, each case represents an option and at last there is an option called default which works when choice doesn't match with any of the cases

 To stop flow after execution of one case, we use break at the end of every case


 Loops: loops are used to iterate a certain statements based on a condition
Loops will stop iterate only if condition is false
we can use while, do while,for(standard, for..in,for..of,forEach)

syntax for a while: 
initialization; 
while(condition){
    //stmnts;
    updation;
}

syntax of do-while:
initialization;
do{
    //stmnts;
    updation;
}while(condition);

var a=17
do{
    console.log(a);a++;
}while(a>=18)

//for
syntax for:
//standard for
for(var i=0;i<=arr.length;i++){
    console.log(arr[i].name)
}
