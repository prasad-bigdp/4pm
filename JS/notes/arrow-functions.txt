A function can be expressed multiple ways in JS.
normal function:
function display()
{
    console.log("hello world")
}
display();
function expression:
let display= function(){
     console.log("hello world")
}
function expressions can be written in more simpler way. 
that modern approach to write function expression is arrow 
functions
let display= ()=>console.log("hello world")
In arrow functions, if only one statement is there, we don't need to write {} or we don't need to use return keyword
